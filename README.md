## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)


For my final project, I will be investigating the affect the COVID pandemic has had on fatal drug overdose deaths in the US.I am using CDC data for both COVID and overdose data, as the CDC records and reports these on a national level with significant details and acuracy. I hypothesize and analyze several aspects of the pandemic that could be causing a concurrent increase in overdose rates.
